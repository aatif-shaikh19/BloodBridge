## Quick summary

This system implements a full-stack Blood Donation Management System (BDMS) with:

* Flask + SQLAlchemy backend with JWT auth and role-based access (donor, admin, hospital).
* OTP verification (6-digit) via Twilio (SMS) and Flask-Mail (email) with expiry & retry/lock logic.
* Aadhaar document upload & admin approval workflow.
* Intelligent matching of donors to urgent hospital requests (blood-type compatibility + 50km radius + last-donation eligibility).
* Notification pipeline: Twilio SMS + email alerts.
* Donation lifecycle: donor accepts request → inventory update → donation recorded → blockchain entry.
* Blockchain-style ledger for donation verification (SHA-256 + proof-of-work).
* RandomForest model for 30-day blood shortage prediction (trained on historical inventory/time-series).
* Gamification: points, badges, leaderboard.
* Drone delivery simulation with GPS updates.
* Admin panel with inventory, approvals, analytics, and blockchain explorer.
* Frontends (user & admin) built as static HTML/CSS/JS with responsive, animated UI.

---

## Highlights / Key features

* **Security**: bcrypt password hashing, JWT validation, rate-limiting on sensitive endpoints, input validation and sanitization, CORS enabled, protections against SQL injection & XSS.
* **Reliability**: file upload constraints (type & size), temp OTP storage and expiry, account lockout after repeated failed OTP attempts.
* **Operational features**: automatic low-stock alerts, expiry tracking (blood expires after 42 days), IoT simulation of storage temperature, admin threshold color-coding, leaderboards.
* **Extensibility**: modular Flask blueprint structure, configuration via `.env` variables, ML model and blockchain difficulty adjustable via config.
* **UX**: gradient UI, animated badges, toast notifications, multi-step registration with OTP, live map & GPS tracker.

---

## Requirements

* OS: Linux / macOS / Windows (WSL recommended for Windows)
* Python 3.10+
* Node.js (only if you plan to run tooling or build pipelines for frontend; plain static frontends do not require Node)
* SQLite (bundled; no separate DB server required)
* Internet access (for Twilio & SMTP if sending messages)
* Recommended RAM: 4GB+

## Install, run & initialize

1. Clone repository (or place project directory)
2. Create & activate a virtualenv:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
   ```
3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Create `.env` from `.env.example` and fill credentials.
5. Run the app (development):

   ```bash
   flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5000
   ```
6. Initialize DB with seed data (endpoint described below) or run script:

   ```bash
   # Option A: API call
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/init-db
   # Option B: CLI script provided in repo (if present)
   python scripts/seed_db.py
   ```

After initialization the server provides RESTful APIs, and static `user.html` and `admin.html` are served (or you can open them directly in a browser if hosted statically).

### Example: Register & OTP flow (simplified)

1. Upload Aadhaar and create pending user:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/register \
  -F "name=Ali" \
  -F "email=ali@example.com" \
  -F "phone=+919876543210" \
  -F "blood_type=O+" \
  -F "password=SuperSafePass123!" \
  -F "aadhaar=@/path/to/aadhaar.jpg"
```

2. Send OTP:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/send-otp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"phone":"+919876543210","email":"ali@example.com"}'
```

3. Verify OTP:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/verify-otp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"phone":"+919876543210","otp":"123456"}'
```

---

## Frontend overview

* `user.html` – Donor-facing UI:

  * Multi-step registration with OTP.
  * Donor dashboard: profile, nearby requests, donate button, donation history with blockchain verification, map + GPS, progress to next badge, animated achievements, leaderboard, voice-control emergency request, AR/VR education placeholder.
  * Toast notifications; responsive design.

* `admin.html` – Admin portal:

  * Login, statistics cards, pending approvals with Aadhaar preview, inventory management (add/update units), request management (create urgent requests), blockchain explorer, drone monitoring panel, charts (donation trends).
  * Color-coded alerts and responsive layout.

**Note**: Frontend uses `fetch()` and async/await, token storage in `localStorage` (or sessionStorage for stricter policies), loading states, and graceful error handling.

---

## Security, validation & reliability

* **Passwords**: hashed with `Flask-Bcrypt` (bcrypt).
* **JWT**: validated on every protected route; token expiry enforced.
* **Rate limiting**: applied to `/api/send-otp`, `/api/login`, and other sensitive endpoints to mitigate abuse.
* **File uploads**: only `pdf`, `jpg`, `jpeg`, `png` allowed; max 5MB; stored in `UPLOAD_FOLDER` with unique filenames. Filenames sanitized.
* **OTP**: 6-digit random OTP; stored with expiry (10 minutes); resend allowed but rate-limited; account locked for repeated failed attempts.
* **SQL injection**: SQLAlchemy ORM prevents raw-string concatenation; all inputs validated and sanitized.
* **XSS**: All user-displayed fields escaped in templates; frontends sanitize input before display.
* **HTTPS**: For production, run behind TLS (nginx, cloud load balancer). Never send credentials over plain HTTP externally.

---

## ML model & blockchain notes

### ML — shortage prediction

* Implemented with `sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor` using historical inventory/time-series features: date, units by blood type, requests, donations, temperature (IoT sim), day-of-week / seasonality flags.
* Predicts per-blood-type units needed for 30 days ahead.
* Configurable via `.env` params (n_estimators, max_depth).
* Model persisted to disk (`models/rf_shortage.pkl`) for reuse; fallback to on-the-fly training if not present.

### Blockchain ledger

* Lightweight chain: blocks contain donation/event JSON, timestamp, previous_hash, nonce, and SHA-256 hash.
* Proof-of-work difficulty adjustable via `BLOCKCHAIN_DIFFICULTY`.
* Admin UI can validate the chain (`/api/blockchain/verify`) and export history.

---

## Testing & seed data

### Initialize DB + seed

Use the `/api/init-db` endpoint to create initial sample data:

* Admin user (email set in seed script).
* 3 sample donors with varying blood types and locations.
* 5 blood inventory entries (A+, A-, B+, O-, AB+).
* 2 sample hospital requests (one urgent).
* Sample blockchain entries and leaderboard points.

Example:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/init-db
```

### Automated tests

* Basic test scripts (if included) will run unit tests for models, auth, and matching logic.
* Manual test checklist:

  * Register → Send OTP → Verify → Admin approves → Login as donor.
  * Create urgent request as hospital/admin → Check top matching donors notified.
  * Donor accepts request → inventory updated; donation recorded & blockchain entry created.
  * Run `POST /api/ml/predict-shortage` and inspect output.
  * Assign a drone and simulate GPS updates via `/api/drone/update-location`.

## Architecture & design notes

* **Backend**: Flask app (`app.py`) structured with modular blueprints: `auth`, `donor`, `admin`, `requests`, `inventory`, `gamification`, `ml`, `blockchain`, `drone`.
* **DB**: SQLAlchemy models representing all entities (User, Donor, Hospital, BloodRequest, BloodInventory, Donation, Blockchain, DroneDelivery, Notification).
* **Asynchronous tasks**: For production, move email/SMS sending, ML training, and blockchain mining to background workers (Celery/RQ). Current implementation logs and runs them synchronously for demo/hackathon simplicity.
* **File storage**: `uploads/` local storage for Aadhaar files. For production, use S3 or other object storage with signed URLs.
* **Scalability**: SQLite is fine for demo; migrate to PostgreSQL for production.

---

## Limitations & recommended improvements

* **Synchronous notifications**: In a high-load scenario, SMS/email should be queued.
* **Privacy**: Aadhaar uploads must follow legal and privacy guidelines; consider encryption at rest & access controls.
* **Proof-of-work cost**: Mining in blockchain is CPU-bound; reduce difficulty or use efficient consensus for real deployment.
* **Testing coverage**: Add unit tests and integration tests for critical flows.
* **Map & geolocation**: Replace placeholder maps with Mapbox/Leaflet + tile keys for production.
* **Drone simulation**: Integrate with realistic path-finding and WebSocket streaming for live updates.

---

## Troubleshooting

* **Error: Twilio authentication failed** — check `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` and `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`.
* **Email not sent** — verify SMTP settings and `MAIL_USE_TLS`/`MAIL_USE_SSL` flags.
* **Uploads failing** — ensure `UPLOAD_FOLDER` exists and server has write permissions.
* **JWT errors** — ensure `JWT_SECRET_KEY` in `.env` matches what Flask expects and token not expired.
* **Database locked** — SQLite may lock if concurrent writes happen; use PostgreSQL for concurrency.

---

## Contribution & license

* Contributions welcome. For hackathon delivery, prefer small, targeted PRs or issues describing the change.
* Suggested branching: `main` for stable demo, `dev` for active work, feature branches for new additions.
* License: Use a permissive license for hackathon sharing (MIT recommended). Add `LICENSE` file before public distribution.

## Appendix: Useful curl examples

* Login:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@example.com","password":"AdminPass!"}'
```

* Create urgent request:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/requests/create \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"hospital_id":1,"blood_type":"A+","units_needed":3,"urgency":"critical","reason":"Surgery","latitude":19.0176,"longitude":72.8562}'
```

* Accept request (donor):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/donor/accept-request/2 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <DONOR_TOKEN>"
```

This project tries to strike a balance: a polished, demo-ready product with production-minded architecture, while staying compact enough for a hackathon timeframe. It showcases the intersection of **AI (ML predictions)**, **distributed trust (blockchain ledger)**, **real-time IoT/drone simulations**, and **practical public service (donor matching & alerts)**. Judges will appreciate clear documentation, reproducible setup, resilient security defaults, and a crisp, attractive UI.
